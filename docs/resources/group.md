# hpeuxi_group (Resource)

Manages a group. 

Note: building a group hierarchy by using an `hpeuxi_group` **resource** `id` as a child group's `parent_group_id` is recommended to maintain dependencies between linked groups. This will help maintain accurate state if the user attempts to change the parent of a non leaf group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create level 1 group attached to the root node
resource "hpeuxi_group" "level_1" {
  name            = "Parent Group"
}

# Create level 2 group attached to level 1 group
resource "hpeuxi_group" "level_2" {
  name            = "Child Group"
  parent_group_id = hpeuxi_group.level_1.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the group.

### Optional

- `parent_group_id` (String) The identifier of the parent of this group. Use `hpeuxi_group` resource (recommended) or datasource id for this attribute. Alternatively leave blank to set group to highest level configurable node.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The identifier of the group.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import level 1 group using its ID
terraform import hpeuxi_group.level_1 <level_1_id>

# Import level 1 group using its ID with an import block
import {
  to = hpeuxi_group.level_1
  id = "level_1_id"
}

# Import level 2 group using its ID
terraform import hpeuxi_group.level_2 <level_2_id>

# Import level 2 group using its ID with an import block
import {
  to = hpeuxi_group.level_2
  id = "level_2_id"
}
```
