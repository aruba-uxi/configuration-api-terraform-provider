# hpeuxi_service_test_group_assignment (Resource)

Manages a service test group assignment.

Note: it is recommended to use a `hpeuxi_group` **resource** `id` as the `group_id`. This will help maintain dependencies between resources. This is useful when a destructive action is performed on an ancestor of the assigned group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hpeuxi_service_test_group_assignment" "my_service_test_group_assignment" {
    service_test_id = hpeuxi_service_test.my_service_test.id
    group_id = hpeuxi_group.my_group.id
}
```
