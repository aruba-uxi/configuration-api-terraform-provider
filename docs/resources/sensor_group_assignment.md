# hpeuxi_sensor_group_assignment (Resource)

Manages a sensor group assignment.

Note: it is recommended to use a `hpeuxi_group` **resource** `id` as the `group_id`. This will help maintain dependencies between resources. This is useful when a destructive action is performed on an ancestor of the assigned group.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hpeuxi_sensor_group_assignment" "my_sensor_group_assignment" {
  sensor_id = hpeuxi_sensor.my_sensor.id
  group_id  = hpeuxi_group.my_group.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `group_id` (String) The identifier of the group to be assigned to. Use `hpeuxi_group` resource id field (recommended); `data.hpeuxi_group` id field or group id here.
- `sensor_id` (String) The identifier of the sensor to be assigned. Use `hpeuxi_sensor` resource id field; `data.hpeuxi_sensor` id field or sensor id here.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The identifier of the sensor group assignment

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import sensor group assignment using its ID
terraform import hpeuxi_sensor_group_assignment.my_sensor_group_assignment <my_sensor_group_assignment_id>

# Import sensor group assignment using its ID with an import block
import {
    to = hpeuxi_sensor_group_assignment.my_sensor_group_assignment
    id = "<my_sensor_group_assignment_id>"
}
```
